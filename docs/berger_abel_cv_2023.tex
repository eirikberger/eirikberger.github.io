``\textbf{Living the American Dream: How Norway Became a High-Mobility
Country''}

I estimate long-run trends in intergenerational mobility in income in
Norway for a period that includes World War II and the creation of the
welfare state. I show that persistence between fathers and sons was high
in the early 20th century but decreased substantially for cohorts born
between the 1920s and 1940s. The convergence of incomes between rural
and urban areas explains about half the total fall in persistence.
First, I relate this result to changes in education by using plausibly
exogenous variation in the intensity of schooling from a primary school
reform, which reduced the gap between cities and rural areas, and find
that it significantly decreased persistence in incomes across
generations. Second, I show that the returns to education fell
dramatically at the beginning of World War II. Comparing persistence for
a set of father-son pairs but using income for the father measured just
before and after this shock, I find that the onset of World War II
lowered persistence in income. These results suggest that equal access
to education and a compressed income distribution are two key drivers
behind Norway's transition to high mobility.

``\textbf{Fertility, Family Formation and Human Capital'' with Aline
BÃ¼tikofer and Kjell G. Salvanes \hfill 2024}

This paper generates new insights into the effect of education on
fertility and partner choice across multiple generations. Using an
intensity-of-treatment design, we leverage population-wide panel data
for Norway in combination with a school reform in the 1930s, changing
the instruction time during the school year in rural municipalities. The
reform was binding for most of the rural population and allows us to
estimate the effect of education on fertility behavior across the
life-cycle, partner choice, and spillover effects on the next
generation's fertility. We present robust evidence of reduced total
fertility and an increase in the age at first birth driven by increased
years of education, better labor market outcomes, and mating with
better-educated partners. In addition, the reform also affected the
fertility behavior of the children and decreased fertility rates across
multiple generations. \vspace{0.3cm}\vspace{-0.2cm}

``\textbf{The Making of Equality: How the Second World War Shaped the
Norwegian Income Distributions'' with Ran Abramitzky and Kjell G.
Salvanes \hfill 2024}

Wars and episodes of violent disruption have often been associated with
reductions in economic inequality, but the underlying dynamics and
mechanisms are less understood. This paper explores World War II's
effect on the income distribution in Norway. We use a newly digitized
individual-level panel of tax records and document a large decline in
income inequality in Norway that occurred during and after World War II
and persisted until the 1980s. We descriptively show that the decline is
driven by large increases in the incomes of the bottom 50 percent of the
income distribution and, to a smaller degree, reductions among the very
rich. Using a shift-share design, we show that more than half the
decline in inequality during the war is caused by large increases in the
prices of agricultural products and fish. We further identify the effect
of massive investments in fortifications, airports, and war-related
manufacturing on local labor markets. While the total effects vary by
investment type, the investments disproportionally increased incomes for
workers with low skills or low incomes before the war. Our analysis
provides an alternative narrative by centering on the bottom 50 percent
of income earners, contrasting with studies focusing primarily on the
top income shares and capital destruction during wartime.

``\textbf{Norwegian Tax Returns from the 20th Century: An Automated
Machine Learning Approach'' with Kjell G. Salvanes \hfill 2024}

High-quality administrative tax data has been instrumental in advancing
economic research over the past several decades. However, the scarcity
of data prior to the 1970s has posed a significant obstacle to the study
of the distribution of economic outcomes across people and generations
in historical settings. We introduce a data set extending Norwegian tax
records to the early 1900s, digitizing more than 270,000 pages. The data
set includes most Norwegian regions and data on name, occupation, place
of residence, income, and wealth. We link observations across years to
significantly enhance the usefulness of the data. We argue that the
methodologies employed in this paper offer significant potential for
application to a wider range of sources and countries.
