                            I estimate long-run trends in intergenerational mobility in income in Norway during a period that includes World War II and the creation of the welfare state. To overcome the challenge of data availability, I digitize and link a novel dataset with more than 16 million observations from tax records between 1924 and 1964 to data on family ties from historical censuses and modern administrative data. I show that persistence between fathers and sons in the income percentile rank was high in the early 20th century but decreased substantially for cohorts born between the 1920s and 1940s. The convergence of rural and urban areas explains about half of the total fall in persistence. First, I link this result to changes in education by using plausibly exogenous variation in the intensity of schooling from a primary school reform, which reduced the gap between cities and rural areas, and find that it significantly decreased persistence. Second, I show that the return to education fell considerably over time, particularly at the beginning of World War II. Comparing persistence for a set of father-son pairs but using income for the father measured just before and after the occupation of Norway during World War II, I find about 13 percent lower persistence in income percentile ranks. These results suggest that equal access to education and low income inequality are two key drivers behind Norway's transition to high mobility.</div>

                            It is well established that wars and episodes of violent disruption have throughout recorded history often been associated with reductions in economic inequality. Combining our newly digitized individual-level panel of official tax records for Norway, occupations, and local labor markets approach, we estimate event history specifications for identifying the local labor market shocks on employment, earnings, and inequality. More precisely, we exploit the idiosyncratic variation across local labor markets in wartime investment in industrial infrastructure, airports, and defense installations, as well as the impact of national-level price shocks on local labor markets dependent on the pre-war intensity of employment in agriculture, fishery, and forestry. Our main findings are as follows. From the descriptive analysis, we find that a large convergence between occupations and municipalities occurred during World War II, and the convergence between municipalities continued until the mid-60s. In our analyses of causal effects comparing treated and non-treated regions of investments and price increases of food and forestry products, we find strong and quite immediate and long-lasting effects both of employment and income of German investments in manufacturing factories, as well as of strong effects on income in areas affected by the enormous price increase of fish and agricultural food products, as well as forest products in the wartime economy.

                            By varying the intensity of compulsory schooling while keeping the number of compulsory school years constant, this paper generates new insights into the effect of human capital on fertility on the extensive and intensive margin. We leverage population-wide panel data for Norway in combination with a school reform in the 1930s changing the instruction time during the school year that allows us to isolate the effect of human capital investment on fertility behavior across the life-cycle from an incarceration effect. We present robust evidence of reduced total fertility driven mostly by an increase in the share of women with one or no children and an increase in the age at first birth by around four months.

                            High-quality administrative tax data has been instrumental in advancing economic research over the past several decades. However, the scarcity of data prior to the 1970s has posed a significant obstacle to the study of the distribution of economic outcomes across people and generations in historical settings. We introduce a dataset extending Norwegian tax records to 1900 by meticulously digitizing more than 270,000 pages. The dataset includes most Norwegian regions and data on name, occupation, place of residence, earnings, and wealth. We link observations across years to significantly enhance the usefulness of the data. We argue that the methodologies employed in this paper offer significant potential for application to a wider range of sources and countries.

                            We estimate the complete income distribution in Norway for 1892, 1906, 1913 and 1929. Compared to previous research, we benefit from better data and more advanced estimation techniques. Our thesis identifies several data weaknesses which have caused bias in previous studies. Much of the data previously used does not distinguish between individual taxpayers and impersonal entities such as stock companies and banks. Another weakness is that before 1921, dividends were not included in the income data. For 1929, the data allows us to create local-level estimates for each Norwegian municipality. We find that the pre-tax, pre-transfers Gini index is stable for the years we analyse, starting at 52 percent in 1892 and ending at 54 percent in 1929. The top 1% income share before taxes and transfers falls over time, declining from 19 percent in 1892 to 12 percent in 1929. We find that shocks to wealth might play a role in this development. Our results differ significantly from those of previous studies. First, we find a Gini index lower than Aaberge, Atkinson and Modalsli (2016). Second, we find lower top incomes and a different development over time than Aaberge, Atkinson and Modalsli (2013). Our results suggest that Norway was already among the most egalitarian countries in Western Europe between 1892 and 1929 in terms of income. However, our estimates are sensitive to total income and to the estimation of stock dividends. Historical estimates from other countries are likely to be sensitive too, leaving a considerable risk of error when comparing.
